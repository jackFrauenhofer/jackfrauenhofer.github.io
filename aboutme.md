As a kid, I once secretly hoarded spoons from the kitchen and stashed them in my room not for mischief, but because I was worried we might run out one day. I think this highlights how I think: I like anticipating problems before they show up and quietly solving them in advance. That same instinct to plan, build, and prepare for the unknown still drives how I approach everything.

# My Background

I grew up in **Menlo Park, California** with a brother, sister, two loving parents, and a golden retriever, Cooper. I  feel incredibly lucky to have been raised in a home filled with love, support, and the kind of values that have shaped who I am today.

# Education

I’m currently pursuing a **B.A. in Computer Science and Economics** at the University of Notre Dame. Before college, I took a gap year through **EF Education First**, traveling through 13 European countries in a language immersion and internship program that expanded both my worldview and my Spotify playlist.

# Interests & Hobbies

In my free time, I love competing — whether it’s playing poker, euchre, or other card games, shooting hoops, or playing (more often than not losing) to my friend Jon Guza in a game of chess. I’m also a huge reader, with a mix of fiction and non-fiction always in my backpack. And of course, I’m a big Los Angeles Lakers fan and never miss a game.
