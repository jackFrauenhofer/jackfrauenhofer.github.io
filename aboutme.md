## My Background

I grew up in Menlo Park, California, with a brother, sister, two loving parents, and a golden retriever, Cooper. As a kid, I once secretly hoarded spoons from the kitchen and stashed them in my room — not for mischief, but because I was worried we might run out one day. I think this highlights how I think: I like anticipating problems before they show up and quietly solving them in advance. That same instinct — to plan, build, and prepare for the unknown — still drives how I approach everything.

## Education

I’m currently pursuing a B.A. at the University of Notre Dame, double majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I’ve been named to the Dean’s List every semester, currently holding a 3.98 GPA. Before college, I took a gap year through EF Education First, traveling through 13 European countries in a language immersion and internship program that expanded both my worldview and my Spotify playlist.
